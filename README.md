# HOLLY | EDUCATE & CELEBRATE  
 
## Project Objective  
Holly integrates data received from multiple server-side API requests to create an interactive Holiday Database. We worked collaboratively through agile development methodologies, and implemented features, functions, and bug fixes through Git.   
## Description  
Holly is a web app that allows users to educate themselves about holidays and events that happen around the world every day.  
## User story  
User 1 - The user wants a website to go that will show them what holidays are being celebrated around the world on that day. I want to be able to celebrate and learn something interesting every day of the year.  
User 2 - As a traveler, I want to be informed of all the holidays taking place when Iâ€™m traveling to a certain country, so I can better adapt to the culture of that country.
